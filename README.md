## How-To

Replicating the results is possible following these steps:
1. Parametrize the surface
2. Prepare surface sample
3. Overfit the surface
4. Neural parametrization of the surface
5. Optimize surface-to-surface map
6. Optimize a map between a collection

#### 1. Surface Parametrization
This is a preprocessing step. You can use SLIM[1] from [this repo](https://github.com/luca-morreale/simple_parametrization) to fulfill this step.

#### 2. Sample preparation
Given a parametrized surface (prev. step), we need to convert it into a sample. First of all, we need to over sample the surface with Meshlab. You can use the midpoint subdivision filter.

Once the super-sampled surface is ready then you can convert it into a sample:
```py
python -m preprocessing.convert_sample surface_slim.obj surface_slim_oversampled.obj output_sample.pth
```
The file `output_sample.pth` is the sample ready to be over-fitted.

#### 3. Overfit surface
A surface representation is generated with:
```py
python -m training_surface_map dataset.sample_path=output_sample.pth
```
This will save a surface map inside `outputs/neural_maps` folder. The folder name follows this patterns: `overfit_[timestamp]`. Inside that folder, the map is saved under the `sample` fodler as `pth` file.

The overfitted surface can be generated with:
```py
python -m show_surface_map
```
please, set the path to the `pth` file just created inside the script.

#### 4. Neural parametrization
Generating a neural parametrization need to run:
```py
python -m training_parametrization_map dataset.sample_path=your_surface_map.pth
```
Like for the overfitting, this saves the map inside `outputs/neural_maps` folder. The folder name have the following patterns `parametrization_[timestamp]`.

To display the paramtrization obtained run:
```py
python -m show_parametrization_map
```
please, set the path to the `pth` file just created inside the script.

#### 5. Optimize surface-to-surface map
To generating a inter-surface map run:
```py
python -m training_intersurface_map dataset.sample_path_g=your_surface_map_a.pth dataset.sample_path_f=your_surface_map_b.pth
```
Note, this steps requires two surface maps. A source, `sample_path_g`, and a target, `sample_path_f`.

Likewise the overfitting, the map is saved inside `outputs/neural_maps`. The inter-surface map folder pattern is `intersurface_[timestamp]`. The `pth` file is inside the `models` folder.

To display the inter-surface map run:
```py
python -m show_intersurface_map
```
remember to set the path of the maps inside the script.


#### 6. Optimize collection map
A collection between a set of surface maps can be optimized with:
```py
python -m training_intersurface_map dataset.sample_path_g=your_surface_map_g.pth dataset.sample_path_f=your_surface_map_f.pth dataset.sample_path_q=your_surface_map_q.pth
```
Note, this steps requires three surface maps. A source, `sample_path_g`, and two targets, `sample_path_f` and `sample_path_q`.

This will save two maps inside `outputs/neural_maps` folder. The folder name follows this patterns: `collection_[timestamp]`, under the folder `models` you can find two `*.pth` file.

To display the collection map run:
```py
python -m show_collection_map
```
remember to set the path of maps inside the script.
